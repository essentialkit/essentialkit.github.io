When compared to typing, voice search is 3x faster, far more ergonomic (no more wrist pains) and the queries are more natural and expressive. I think the main reason typing is more popular than speaking is because the keyboard preceded the microphone, and it took long for speech-to-text software to reach the point of understanding accents. It's about time we reversed the statistic!
